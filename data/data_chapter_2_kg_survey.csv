Prior research on human and explainable AI interactions has focused on measures such as interpretability, trust, and usability of the explanation. Whether explainable AI can improve actual human decision-making and the ability to identify the problems with the underlying model are open questions. Using real datasets, we compare and evaluate objective human decision accuracy without AI (control), with an AI prediction (no explanation), and AI prediction with explanation. We find providing any kind of AI prediction tends to improve user decision accuracy, but no conclusive evidence that explainable AI has a meaningful impact. Moreover, we observed the strongest predictor for human decision accuracy was AI accuracy and that users were somewhat able to detect when the AI was correct versus incorrect, but this was not significantly affected by including an explanation. Our results indicate that, at least in some situations, the \textquotedblwhy\textquotedbl information provided in explainable AI may not enhance user decision-making, and further research may be needed to understand how to integrate explainable AI into real systems.","2020-06-19","2021-11-22 11:44:02","2022-08-06 05:02:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed model with accuracy of 97.92 per cent, in comparison to RFM, had much better performance in churn prediction and among the supervised machine learning methods, artificial neural network (ANN) had the highest accuracy, and decision trees (DT) was the least accurate one. The results show the substantially superiority of boosting versions in prediction compared with simple and bagging models.,The period of the available data was limited to two years. The research data were limited to only one grocery store whereby it may not be applicable to other industries; therefore, generalizing the results to other business centers should be used with caution.,Business owners must try to enforce a clear rule to provide a prize for a certain number of purchased items. Of course, the prize can be something other than the purchased item. Business owners must accept the items returned by the customers for any reasons, and the conditions for accepting returned items and the deadline for accepting the returned items must be clearly communicated to the customers. Store owners must consider a discount for a certain amount of purchase from the store. They have to use an exponential rule to increase the discount when the amount of purchase is increased to encourage customers for more purchase. The managers of large stores must try to quickly deliver the ordered items, and they should use equipped and new transporting vehicles and skilled and friendly workforce for delivering the items. It is recommended that the types of services, the rules for prizes, the discount, the rules for accepting the returned items and the method of distributing the items must be prepared and shown in the store for all the customers to see. The special services and reward rules of the store must be communicated to the customers using new media such as social networks. To predict the customer behaviors based on the data, the future researchers should use the boosting method because it increases efficiency and accuracy of prediction. It is recommended that for predicting the customer behaviors, particularly their churning status, the ANN method be used. To extract and select the important and effective variables influencing customer behaviors, the discriminant analysis method can be used which is a very accurate and powerful method for predicting the classes of the customers.,The current study tries to fill this gap by considering five basic and important variables besides RFM in stores, i.e. prize, discount, accepting returns, delay in distribution and the number of items, so that the business owners can understand the role services such as prizes, discount, distribution and accepting returns play in retraining the customers and preventing them from churning. Another innovation of the current study is the comparison of machine-learning methods with their boosting and bagging versions, especially considering the fact that previous studies do not consider the bagging method. The other reason for the study is the conflicting results regarding the superiority of machine-learning methods in a more accurate prediction of customer behaviors, including churning. For example, some studies introduce ANN (Huang et al., 2010; Hung and Wang, 2004; Keramati et al., 2014; Runge et al., 2014), some introduce support vector machine ( Guo-en and Wei-dong, 2008; Vafeiadis et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2011) and some introduce DT (Freund and Schapire, 1996; Qureshi et al., 2013; Umayaparvathi and Iyakutti, 2012) as the best predictor, confusing the users of the results of these studies regarding the best prediction method. The current study identifies the best prediction method specifically in the field of store businesses for researchers and the owners. Moreover, another innovation of the current study is using discriminant analysis for selecting and filtering variables which are important and effective in predicting churners and non-churners, which is not used in previous studies. Therefore, the current study is unique considering the used variables, the method of comparing their accuracy and the method of selecting effective variables.","2017","2021-11-22 11:44:03","2022-08-06 05:00:09","","65–93","","1/2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jsit-10-2016-0061/full/pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often explanations are given in form of model simplifications or visualizations. However, as shown in cognitive science as well as in early AI research, concept understanding can also be improved by the alignment of a given instance for a concept with a similar counterexample. Contrasting a given instance with a structurally similar example which does not belong to the concept highlights what characteristics are necessary for concept membership. Such near misses have been proposed by Winston (1970) as efficient guidance for learning in relational domains. We introduce an explanation generation algorithm for relational concepts learned with Inductive Logic Programming (<span style=""small-caps"">GeNME</span>). The algorithm identifies near miss examples from a given set of instances and ranks these examples by their degree of closeness to a specific positive instance. A modified rule which covers the near miss but not the original instance is given as an explanation. We illustrate <span style=""small-caps"">GeNME</span> with the well known family domain consisting of kinship relations, the visual relational Winston arches domain and a real-world domain dealing with file management. We also present a psychological experiment comparing human preferences of rule-based, example-based, and near miss explanations in the family and the arches domains.","2021-06-15","2021-11-22 11:44:03","2022-08-06 05:00:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"TP3DBBQY","book","2000","","Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations","","978-1-4613-7104-5","","","","Modern marketing techniques in industrialized countries cannot be implemented without segmentation of the potential market. Goods are no longer produced and sold without a significant consideration of customer needs combined with a recognition that these needs are heterogeneous. Since first emerging in the late 1950s, the concept of segmentation has been one of the most researched topics in the marketing literature. Segmentation has become a central topic to both the theory and practice of marketing, particularly in the recent development of finite mixture models to better identify market segments. This second edition of Market Segmentation updates and extends the integrated examination of segmentation theory and methodology begun in the first edition. A chapter on mixture model analysis of paired comparison data has been added, together with a new chapter on the pros and cons of the mixture model. The book starts with a framework for considering the various bases and methods available for conducting segmentation studies. The second section contains a more detailed discussion of the methodology for market segmentation, from traditional clustering algorithms to more recent developments in finite mixtures and latent class models. Three types of finite mixture models are discussed in this second section: simple mixtures, mixtures of regressions and mixtures of unfolding models. The third main section is devoted to special topics in market segmentation such as joint segmentation, segmentation using tailored interviewing and segmentation with structural equation models. The fourth part covers four major approaches to applied market segmentation: geo-demographic, lifestyle, response-based, and conjoint analysis. The final concluding section discusses directions for further research","2000","2021-11-22 11:44:04","2022-08-06 05:00:56","","","","","8","","","","International Series in Quantitative Marketing","","","","Springer","Boston, MA","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4651-1","","","","","","Wedel, Michel; Kamakura, Wagner A.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Second Edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to investigate the effects of cost and benefit factors on trust and inter-organizational cooperative behaviors among suppliers in automotive NPD projects from the perspective of social exchange theory (SET).,The structural equation modeling method is applied to test the proposed model, which is based on the analysis of survey data from 272 product managers of automotive part suppliers.,Knowledge sharing and coordination effort influence inter-organizational cooperation indirectly through trust. Specially, trust is negatively influenced by coordination effort but positively affected by knowledge sharing. Requirement uncertainty moderates the relationship between cost–benefit factors and trust differently. Specifically, requirement uncertainty increases the negative influence of coordination effort on trust but also strengthens the positive effect of knowledge sharing on trust.,This study provides a relatively comprehensive cost–benefit framework for further understanding the formation mechanism of inter-organizational cooperation among suppliers. It also contributes to SET by incorporating the contextual factor to explain the moderating effect of requirement uncertainty on the relationships between cost–benefit factors and trust in the context of automotive NPD projects.","2020","2021-11-22 11:44:04","2022-08-06 05:01:07","","79–97","","1","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/imds-04-2019-0217/full/pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As of late, explainable AI has become a very active ﬁeld of research by addressing the limitations of the latest machine learning solutions that often provide highly accurate, but hardly scrutable and interpretable decisions. An increasing interest has also been shown in the integration of Knowledge Representation techniques in Machine Learning applications, mostly motivated by the complementary strengths and weaknesses that could lead to a new generation of hybrid intelligent systems. Following this idea, we hypothesise that knowledge graphs, which naturally provide domain background knowledge in a machine-readable format, could be integrated in Explainable Machine Learning approaches to help them provide more meaningful, insightful and trustworthy explanations. Using a systematic literature review methodology we designed an analytical framework to explore the current landscape of Explainable Machine Learning. We focus particularly on the integration with structured knowledge at large scale, and use our framework to analyse a variety of Machine Learning domains, identifying the main characteristics of such knowledge-based, explainable systems from different perspectives. We then summarise the strengths of such hybrid systems, such as improved understandability, reactivity, and accuracy, as well as their limitations, e.g. in handling noise or extracting knowledge eﬃciently. We conclude by discussing a list of open challenges left for future research.","2022","2021-11-24 12:27:53","2022-11-09 12:30:38","","103627","","","302","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/PB34LVAR/2022_Tiddi_Knowledge_graphs_as_tools_for_explainable.pdf","","Knowledge_graphs; XAI; Neuro-symbolic integration; Subsymbolic AI; Symbolic AI; Neuro-Symbolic Integration; Knowledge<sub>g</sub>raphs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although numerous efforts have been made toward more personalizedrecommendations, recommender systems still suffer from several challenges, such as data sparsity and cold-start problems. In recentyears, generating recommendations with the knowledge graph as side information has attracted considerable interest. Such anapproach can not only alleviate the above mentioned issues for a more accurate recommendation, but also provide explanations forrecommended items. In this paper, we conduct a systematical survey of knowledge graph-based recommender systems. We collectrecently published papers in this field, and group them into three categories, i.e., embedding-based methods, connection-basedmethods, and propagation-based methods. Also, we further subdivide each category according to the characteristics of theseapproaches. Moreover, we investigate the proposed algorithms by focusing on how the papers utilize the knowledge graph for accurateand explainable recommendation. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field.","2020","2022-03-10 09:23:27","2022-11-09 12:29:10","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/HLY5SXF7/2020_Guo_A_Survey_on_Knowledge_Graph-Based_Recommender_Systems.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, traditional data analysis methods cannot adapt to the growth rate of massive multi-source spatio-temporal data and explain the practical significance of results. To explore the network structure and semantic relationships, we propose a general framework for multi-source spatio-temporal data analysis via knowledge graph embedding. The framework extracts low-dimensional feature representation from multi-source spatio-temporal data in a high-dimensional space, and recognizes the network structure and semantic relationships about multi-source spatio-temporal data. Experiment results show that the framework can not only effectively utilize multi-source spatio-temporal data, but also explore the network structure and semantic relationship. Taking real Shanghai datasets as an example, we confirm the validity of the multi-source spatio-temporal data analytical framework based on knowledge graph embedding.","2020","2022-03-10 09:23:28","2022-11-09 12:29:19","","199","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/YB9KGFSM/2020_Zhao_Urban_Multi-Source_Spatio-Temporal_Data_Analysis.pdf","","data analysis; embedded learning; knowledge graph; Knowledge graph embeddings; Knowledge graphs; multi-source spatio-temporal data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the concept of knowledge graph embeddings by explaining what they are, how they can be generated and how they can be evaluated. We summarize the state-of-the-art in this field by describing the approaches that have been introduced to represent knowledge in the vector space. In relation to knowledge representation, we consider the problem of explainability, and discuss models and methods for explaining predictions obtained via knowledge graph embeddings.","2020-04","2022-03-10 09:23:29","2022-11-09 12:29:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/HDYHDRBG/2020_Bianchi_KGE_and_XAI.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As GNNs tightly entangle the input graph into the neural network structure, common explainable AI approaches are not applicable. To a large extent, GNNs have remained black-boxes for the user so far. In this paper, we show that GNNs can in fact be naturally explained using higher-order expansions, i.e. by identifying groups of edges that jointly contribute to the prediction. Practically, we find that such explanations can be extracted using a nested attribution scheme, where existing techniques such as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) can be applied at each step. The output is a collection of walks into the input graph that are relevant for the prediction. Our novel explanation method, which we denote by GNN-LRP, is applicable to a broad range of graph neural networks and lets us extract practically relevant insights on sentiment analysis of text data, structure-property relationships in quantum chemistry, and image classification.","2020-06","2022-03-10 09:23:29","2022-11-09 12:30:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/3Z2Z33VZ/2020_Schnake_Higher-Order_Explanations_of_GNNs_via_Relevant_Walks.pdf","","★","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, a promising approach to this problem has been to embed KG entities as well as the query into a vector space such that entities that answer the query are embedded close to the query. However, prior work models queries as single points in the vector space, which is problematic because a complex query represents a potentially large set of its answer entities, but it is unclear how such a set can be represented as a single point. Furthermore, prior work can only handle queries that use conjunctions ($\wedge$) and existential quantifiers ($\exists$). Handling queries with logical disjunctions ($\vee$) remains an open problem. Here we propose query2box, an embedding-based framework for reasoning over arbitrary queries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, and $\exists$ operators in massive and incomplete KGs. Our main insight is that queries can be embedded as boxes (i.e., hyper-rectangles), where a set of points inside the box corresponds to a set of answer entities of the query. We show that conjunctions can be naturally represented as intersections of boxes and also prove a negative result that handling disjunctions would require embedding with dimension proportional to the number of KG entities. However, we show that by transforming queries into a Disjunctive Normal Form, query2box is capable of handling arbitrary logical queries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\exists$ in a scalable manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of query2box on three large KGs and show that query2box achieves up to 25% relative improvement over the state of the art.","2020-02","2022-03-10 09:23:29","2022-11-09 12:30:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/5X6PX9SB/2020_Ren_Query2box-Reasoning_over_Knowledge_Graphs_in_Vector_Space_using_Box_Embeddings.pdf","","★","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, almost all existing studies are based on high predictability data conditions while pay less attention to the data condition with low predictability, where the regularity of single individuals is not exposed. Based on a certain period of observation, there is a fact that individuals may choose destinations beyond observation, which we call ""potential destinations"". The number of potential destinations is very large and can't be ignored for the data condition with low predictability formed by short-term observation.To reveal the choice pattern of potential destination of individuals under the data condition with low predictability, we propose a global optimization method based on knowledge graph embedding. First, we joint the trip data of all individuals by constructing Trip Knowledge Graph(TKG). Next, we optimize the general algorithm of knowledge graph embedding for our data and task in training strategy and objective function, then implement it on TKG. It can achieve global optimization for association paths that exist between almost any two entities in TKG. On this basis, a method for potential destination prediction is proposed, giving the possible ranking of unobserved destinations for each individual. In addition, we improve the performance by fusing static statistical information that is not passed to TKG. Finally, we validate our method in a real-world dataset, and the prediction results are highly consistent with individuals' potential destination choice behaviour.","2022-01","2022-03-10 09:23:29","2022-08-06 05:00:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","★","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, KGs are popularly used as the auxiliary information to enable more accurate, explainable, and diverse user preference recommendations. Specifically, existing KG-based recommendation methods target modeling high-order relations/dependencies from long connectivity user-item interactions hidden in KG. However, most of them ignore the cold-start problems (i.e., user cold-start and item cold-start) of recommendation analytics, which restricts their performance in scenarios when involving new users or new items. Inspired by the success of meta-learning on scarce training samples, we propose a novel meta-learning based framework called MetaKG, which encompasses a collaborative-aware meta learner and a knowledge-aware meta learner, to capture meta users' preference and entities' knowledge for cold-start recommendations. The collaborative-aware meta learner aims to locally aggregate user preferences for each user preference learning task. In contrast, the knowledge-aware meta learner is to globally generalize knowledge representation across different user preference learning tasks. Guided by two meta learners, MetaKG can effectively capture the high-order collaborative relations and semantic representations, which could be easily adapted to cold-start scenarios. Besides, we devise a novel adaptive task scheduler which can adaptively select the informative tasks for meta learning in order to prevent the model from being corrupted by noisy tasks. Extensive experiments on various cold-start scenarios using three real data sets demonstrate that our presented MetaKG outperforms all the existing state-of-the-art competitors in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.","2022-02","2022-03-10 09:23:29","2022-11-09 12:29:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/KVMS5JIE/2022_Du_et_al_MetaKG.pdf","","★","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results of this endeavor are Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs). In this survey on MMKGs constructed by texts and images, we first give definitions of MMKGs, followed with the preliminaries on multi-modal tasks and techniques.

"EHZWIMGX","journalArticle","2022","Zhang, Zhanqiu; Wang, Jie; Ye, Jieping; Wu, Feng","Rethinking Graph Convolutional Networks in Knowledge Graph Completion","","","","","","Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) – which are effective in modeling graph structures – have been increasingly popular in knowledge graph completion (KGC). GCN-based KGC models first use GCNs to generate expressive entity representations and then use knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models to capture the interactions among entities and relations. However, many GCN-based KGC models fail to outperform state-of-the-art KGE models though introducing additional computational complexity. This phenomenon motivates us to explore the real effect of GCNs in KGC. Therefore, in this paper, we build upon representative GCN-based KGC models and introduce variants to find which factor of GCNs is critical in KGC. Surprisingly, we observe from experiments that the graph structure modeling in GCNs does not have a significant impact on the performance of KGC models, which is in contrast to the common belief. Instead, the transformations for entity representations are responsible for the performance improvements. Based on the observation, we propose a simple yet effective framework named LTE-KGE, which equips existing KGE models with linearly transformed entity embeddings. Experiments demonstrate that LTE-KGE models lead to similar performance improvements with GCN-based KGC methods, while being more computationally efficient. These results suggest that existing GCNs are unnecessary for KGC, and novel GCN-based KGC models should count on more ablation studies to validate their effectiveness. The code of all the experiments is available on GitHub at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/GCN4KGC.","2022-02","2022-03-10 09:23:29","2022-11-09 12:30:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","★","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior research on human and explainable AI interactions has focused on measures such as interpretability, trust, and usability of the explanation. Whether explainable AI can improve actual human decision-making and the ability to identify the problems with the underlying model are open questions. Using real datasets, we compare and evaluate objective human decision accuracy without AI (control), with an AI prediction (no explanation), and AI prediction with explanation. We find providing any kind of AI prediction tends to improve user decision accuracy, but no conclusive evidence that explainable AI has a meaningful impact. Moreover, we observed the strongest predictor for human decision accuracy was AI accuracy and that users were somewhat able to detect when the AI was correct versus incorrect, but this was not significantly affected by including an explanation. Our results indicate that, at least in some situations, the ""why"" information provided in explainable AI may not enhance user decision-making, and further research may be needed to understand how to integrate explainable AI into real systems.","2020","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-08-05 22:42:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11194","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the significance of feature selection, it is crucial for the calculated importance scores to reflect reality. Falsely overestimating the importance of irrelevant features can lead to false discoveries, while underestimating importance of relevant features may lead us to discard important features, resulting in poor model performance. Additionally, black-box models like XGBoost provide state-of-the art predictive performance, but cannot be easily understood by humans, and thus we rely on variable importance scores or methods for explainability like SHAP to offer insight into their behavior.  In this paper, we investigate the performance of variable importance as a feature selection method across various black-box and interpretable machine learning methods. We compare the ability of CART, Optimal Trees, XGBoost and SHAP to correctly identify the relevant subset of variables across a number of experiments. The results show that regardless of whether we use the native variable importance method or SHAP, XGBoost fails to clearly distinguish between relevant and irrelevant features. On the other hand, the interpretable methods are able to correctly and efficiently identify irrelevant features, and thus offer significantly better performance for feature selection.","2021","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-08-29 12:49:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05328","Explainable_feature_selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often explanations are given in form of model simplifications or visualizations. However, as shown in cognitive science as well as in early AI research, concept understanding can also be improved by the alignment of a given instance for a concept with a similar counterexample. Contrasting a given instance with a structurally similar example which does not belong to the concept highlights what characteristics are necessary for concept membership. Such near misses have been proposed by Winston (1970) as efficient guidance for learning in relational domains. We introduce an explanation generation algorithm for relational concepts learned with Inductive Logic Programming (GeNME). The algorithm identifies near miss examples from a given set of instances and ranks these examples by their degree of closeness to a specific positive instance. A modified rule which covers the near miss but not the original instance is given as an explanation. We illustrate GeNME with the well known family domain consisting of kinship relations, the visual relational Winston arches domain and a real-world domain dealing with file management. We also present a psychological experiment comparing human preferences of rule-based, example-based, and near miss explanations in the family and the arches domains.","2021","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-08-05 22:42:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08064","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To provide guidance in selecting and evaluating interpretation methods, we introduce 3 desiderata: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy. Using our framework, we review existing work, grounded in real-world studies which exemplify our desiderata, and suggest directions for future work.           ,              Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.","2019-10-29","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-11-09 12:29:17","2022-03-29 21:00:24","22071-22080","","44","116","","Proc.

The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size.

Our framework---which we term ""Graph Network-based Simulators"" (GNS)---represents the state of a physical system with particles, expressed as nodes in a graph, and computes dynamics via learned message-passing. Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework advances the state-of-the-art in learned physical simulation, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.","2020-09-14","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-11-09 12:30:26","2022-04-07 07:28:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2002.09405","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/YZ39LPGU/Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. - 2020 - Learning to Simulate Complex Physics with Graph Ne.pdf; /Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/UAZZCCU3/2002.html","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Physics - Computational Physics; Statistics - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This however comes at the cost of dubious trustworthiness and significant risk of exposure to 'fake news', intentionally written to mislead the readers. Automatically detecting fake news poses challenges that defy existing content-based analysis approaches. One of the main reasons is that often the interpretation of the news requires the knowledge of political or social context or 'common sense', which current NLP algorithms are still missing. Recent studies have shown that fake and real news spread differently on social media, forming propagation patterns that could be harnessed for the automatic fake news detection. Propagation-based approaches have multiple advantages compared to their content-based counterparts, among which is language independence and better resilience to adversarial attacks. In this paper we show a novel automatic fake news detection model based on geometric deep learning. The underlying core algorithms are a generalization of classical CNNs to graphs, allowing the fusion of heterogeneous data such as content, user profile and activity, social graph, and news propagation. Our model was trained and tested on news stories, verified by professional fact-checking organizations, that were spread on Twitter. Our experiments indicate that social network structure and propagation are important features allowing highly accurate (92.7% ROC AUC) fake news detection. Second, we observe that fake news can be reliably detected at an early stage, after just a few hours of propagation. Third, we test the aging of our model on training and testing data separated in time. Our results point to the promise of propagation-based approaches for fake news detection as an alternative or complementary strategy to content-based approaches.","2019-02-10","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-11-09 12:29:16","2022-04-07 07:30:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1902.06673","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/QIKDBYTH/Monti et al. - 2019 - Fake News Detection on Social Media using Geometri.pdf; /Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/CLU62VIF/1902.html","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Social and Information Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) were shown to be successful in effectively representing graph structured data because of their good performance and generalization ability. GNN is a deep learning based method that learns a node representation by combining specific nodes and the structural/topological information of a graph. However, like other deep models, explaining the effectiveness of GNN models is a challenging task because of the complex nonlinear transformations made over the iterations. In this paper, we propose GraphLIME, a local interpretable model explanation for graphs using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) Lasso, which is a nonlinear feature selection method. GraphLIME is a generic GNN-model explanation framework that learns a nonlinear interpretable model locally in the subgraph of the node being explained. More specifically, to explain a node, we generate a nonlinear interpretable model from its $N$-hop neighborhood and then compute the K most representative features as the explanations of its prediction using HSIC Lasso. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, the explanations of GraphLIME are found to be of extraordinary degree and more descriptive in comparison to the existing explanation methods.","2020-09-27","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-05-20 09:01:09","","","","","","","GraphLIME","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Number: arXiv:2001.06216 arXiv:2001.06216 [cs, stat]","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/3JIVDA93/Huang et al. - 2020 - GraphLIME Local Interpretable Model Explanations .pdf; /Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/6DQIAD3S/2001.html","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mere predictive power of the graph classifier is of limited interest to the neuroscientists, which have plenty of tools for the diagnosis of specific mental disorders. What matters is the interpretation of the model, as it can provide novel insights and new hypotheses. In this paper we propose \emph{counterfactual graphs} as a way to produce local post-hoc explanations of any black-box graph classifier. Given a graph and a black-box, a counterfactual is a graph which, while having high structural similarity with the original graph, is classified by the black-box in a different class. We propose and empirically compare several strategies for counterfactual graph search. Our experiments against a white-box classifier with known optimal counterfactual, show that our methods, although heuristic, can produce counterfactuals very close to the optimal one. Finally, we show how to use counterfactual graphs to build global explanations correctly capturing the behaviour of different black-box classifiers and providing interesting insights for the neuroscientists.","2021-06-18","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-05-27 09:09:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Number: arXiv:2106.08640 arXiv:2106.08640 [cs]","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/RSEYF3Q9/Abrate and Bonchi - 2021 - Counterfactual Graphs for Explainable Classificati.pdf; /Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/2FD54ZB3/2106.html","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Social and Information Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there has been little work on interpreting them, and specifically on understanding which parts of the graphs (e.g. syntactic trees or co-reference structures) contribute to a prediction. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc method for interpreting the predictions of GNNs which identifies unnecessary edges. Given a trained GNN model, we learn a simple classifier that, for every edge in every layer, predicts if that edge can be dropped. We demonstrate that such a classifier can be trained in a fully differentiable fashion, employing stochastic gates and encouraging sparsity through the expected  norm. We use our technique as an attribution method to analyze GNN models for two tasks -- question answering and semantic role labeling -- providing insights into the information flow in these models. We show that we can drop a large proportion of edges without deteriorating the performance of the model, while we can analyse the remaining edges for interpreting model predictions.","2021","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-08-05 22:42:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/RNQZG6VY/Schlichtkrull et al. - 2021 - Interpreting Graph Neural Networks for NLP With Di.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A major limitation of deep models is that they are not amenable to interpretability. This limitation can be circumvented by developing post hoc techniques to explain the predictions, giving rise to the area of explainability. Recently, explainability of deep models on images and texts has achieved significant progress. In the area of graph data, graph neural networks (GNNs) and their explainability are experiencing rapid developments. However, there is neither a unified treatment of GNN explainability methods, nor a standard benchmark and testbed for evaluations. In this survey, we provide a unified and taxonomic view of current GNN explainability methods. Our unified and taxonomic treatments of this subject shed lights on the commonalities and differences of existing methods and set the stage for further methodological developments. To facilitate evaluations, we generate a set of benchmark graph datasets specifically for GNN explainability. We summarize current datasets and metrics for evaluating GNN explainability. Altogether, this work provides a unified methodological treatment of GNN explainability and a standardized testbed for evaluations.","2021-03-25","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-08-05 22:42:31","2022-07-01 06:52:39","","","","","","","Explainability in Graph Neural Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2012.15445 [cs]","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/WVTMK9RT/Yuan et al. - 2021 - Explainability in Graph Neural Networks A Taxonom.pdf; /Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/DSBVRLPY/2012.html","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several recent works suggest that convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models can capture interactions between head and relation embeddings, and hence perform well on knowledge graph completion. However, previous convolutional network models have ignored the different contributions of different interaction features to the experimental results. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding model named DyConvNE for knowledge base completion. Our model DyConvNE uses a dynamic convolution kernel because the dynamic convolutional kernel can assign weights of varying importance to interaction features. We also propose a new method of negative sampling, which mines hard negative samples as additional negative samples for training. We have performed experiments on the data sets WN18RR and FB15k-237, and the results show that our method is better than several other benchmark algorithms for knowledge graph completion. In addition, we used a new test method when predicting the Hits@1 values of WN18RR and FB15k-237, named specific-relationship testing. This method gives about a 2% relative improvement over models that do not use this method in terms of Hits@1.","2022-03-04","2022-08-05 22:58:03","2022-08-05 22:58:15","2022-08-05 22:58:03","133","","3","13","","Information","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/FLHRP8DN/Peng and Wu - 2022 - A Dynamic Convolutional Network-Based Model for Kn.pdf","","To_Do","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The multi-hop paths in KGs can provide auxiliary facts for improving recommendation performance as well as explainability. However, existing studies may suffer from two major challenges: error propagation and weak explainability. Considering all paths between every user-item pair might involve irrelevant ones, which leads to error propagation of user preferences. Defining meta-paths might alleviate the error propagation, but the recommendation performance would heavily depend on the pre-defined meta-paths. Some recent methods based on graph convolution network (GCN) achieve better recommendation performance, but fail to provide explainability. To tackle the above problems, we propose a novel method named               K               nowledge-aware               R               easoning with               G               raph               C               onvolution               N               etwork (KR-GCN). Specifically, to alleviate the effect of error propagation, we design a transition-based method to determine the triple-level scores and utilize nucleus sampling to select triples within the paths between every user-item pair adaptively. To improve the recommendation performance and guarantee the diversity of explanations, user-item interactions and knowledge graphs are integrated into a heterogeneous graph, which is performed with the graph convolution network. A path-level self-attention mechanism is adopted to discriminate the contributions of different selected paths and predict the interaction probability, which improves the relevance of the final explanation. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that KR-GCN consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. And human evaluation proves the superiority of KR-GCN on explainability.","2022-03-15","2022-08-05 23:03:21","2022-08-05 23:03:21","2022-08-05 23:03:21","3511019","","","","","ACM Trans. Inf.

The KG completion task (KGC) automatically predicts missing facts based on an incomplete KG. However, existing methods perform unsatisfactorily in real-world scenarios. On the one hand, their performance will dramatically degrade along with the increasing sparsity of KGs. On the other hand, the inference procedure for prediction is an untrustworthy black box. This paper proposes a novel explainable model for sparse KGC, compositing high-order reasoning into a graph convolutional network, namely HoGRN. It can not only improve the generalization ability to mitigate the information insufficiency issue but also provide interpretability while maintaining the model's effectiveness and efficiency. There are two main components that are seamlessly integrated for joint optimization. First, the high-order reasoning component learns high-quality relation representations by capturing endogenous correlation among relations. This can reflect logical rules to justify a broader of missing facts. Second, the entity updating component leverages a weight-free Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to efficiently model KG structures with interpretability. Unlike conventional methods, we conduct entity aggregation and design composition-based attention in the relational space without additional parameters. The lightweight design makes HoGRN better suitable for sparse settings. For evaluation, we have conducted extensive experiments-the results of HoGRN on several sparse KGs present impressive improvements (9% MRR gain on average). Further ablation and case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the main components. Our codes will be released upon acceptance.","2022-07-14","2022-08-05 23:11:51","2022-08-05 23:11:51","2022-08-05 23:11:51","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2207.07503 [cs]","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/FTK37KRG/Chen et al. - 2022 - Explainable Sparse Knowledge Graph Completion via .pdf; /Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/8IWESN3C/2207.html","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2207.07503","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such models are usually evaluated with averaged metrics on a held-out test set. While useful for tracking progress, averaged single-score metrics cannot reveal what exactly a model has learned -- or failed to learn. To address this issue, we propose KGxBoard: an interactive framework for performing fine-grained evaluation on meaningful subsets of the data, each of which tests individual and interpretable capabilities of a KGC model.

GANs exhibit strong performance in imaging or anomaly detection. However, they suffer from training instabilities, and sampling efficiency may be limited by the classical sampling procedure. We introduce variational quantum-classical Wasserstein GANs to address these issues and embed this model in a classical machine learning framework for anomaly detection. Classical Wasserstein GANs improve training stability by using a cost function better suited for gradient descent. Our model replaces the generator of Wasserstein GANs with a hybrid quantum-classical neural net and leaves the classical discriminative model unchanged. This way, high-dimensional classical data only enters the classical model and need not be prepared in a quantum circuit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a credit card fraud dataset. For this dataset our method shows performance on par with classical methods in terms of the F₁ score. We analyze the influence of the circuit ansatz, layer width and depth, neural net architecture parameter initialization strategy, and sampling noise on convergence and performance.","","2022-08-29 12:56:19","2022-08-29 12:56:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, most methods are transductive, i.e., they are based on dimensionality reduction architectures. Hence, they require heavy retraining every time new items or users are added. Conversely, inductive methods promise to solve these issues. Nonetheless, all inductive methods rely only on interactions, making recommendations for users with few interactions sub-optimal and even impossible for new items. Therefore, we focus on inductive methods able to also exploit knowledge graphs (KGs). In this work, we propose SimpleRec, a strong baseline that uses a graph neural network and a KG to provide better recommendations than related inductive methods for new users and items. We show that it is unnecessary to create complex model architectures for user representations, but it is enough to allow users to be represented by the few ratings they provide and the indirect connections among them without any user metadata. As a result, we re-evaluate state-of-the-art methods, identify better evaluation protocols, highlight unwarranted conclusions from previous proposals, and showcase a novel, stronger baseline for this task.","2022-09-13","2022-09-19 07:33:19","2022-09-19 07:33:19","2022-09-19 07:33:19","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2209.04185 [cs]","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/62RUKDT9/Jendal et al. - 2022 - Simple and Powerful Architecture for Inductive Rec.pdf; /Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/NIFLR94D/2209.html","","","Computer Science - Information Retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2209.04185","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although it is generally believed that gratification reflects the gains through use and that addiction is caused by excessive use of the technology, limited research has been done to empirically verify the relationship between usage patterns and gratification versus addiction. This paper attempts to explore the impacts of posting patterns on gratification and addiction dimensions for microblog platforms. On the basis of existing literature on use and gratifications of media users, we focus on examining the different posting patterns between weekdays and weekends. By using multiple data collection methods, a data set was obtained consisting of 308 microblog users. Our analysis shows that the overall posting frequency is not significantly related to gratification and addiction levels. Moreover, the posting of microblogs is usually more intensive on weekdays than on weekends. Heavy weekend users tend to feel more socially gratified and are most likely to be addicted. In contrast, heavy weekday users are usually not addicted, and reported the lowest levels of gratification among all users. Balanced users that do not display distinguishable difference between weekdays and weekends manifest gratification levels around the average levels, and are less addicted than weekend users, even if their overall usage amounts are heavy.","2017-07-01","2022-10-03 11:43:28","2022-10-03 11:43:28","","613-624","","5","54","","Information & Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Addiction; Microblog; Use and gratification; Weekdays and weekends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such sequences are typically non-stationary, exhibiting distribution shifts over time -- a challenging scenario for the forecasting task, due to the problems of covariate shift, and conditional distribution shift. In this paper, we show that deep time-index models possess strong synergies with a meta-learning formulation of forecasting, displaying significant advantages over existing neural forecasting methods in tackling the problems arising from non-stationarity. These advantages include having a stronger smoothness prior, avoiding the problem of covariate shift, and having better sample efficiency. To this end, we propose DeepTime, a deep time-index model trained via meta-learning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets in the long sequence time-series forecasting setting demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods, and is highly efficient.

It is crucial to address the curse of dimensionality, enhance model generalization, overcome data sparsity, and expand the availability of classic models. Current research focuses on domain knowledge-based feature engineering or learning latent representations; nevertheless, these methods are not entirely automated and cannot produce a traceable and optimal representation space. When rebuilding a feature space for a machine learning task, can these limitations be addressed concurrently? In this extension study, we present a self-optimizing framework for feature transformation. To achieve a better performance, we improved the preliminary work by (1) obtaining an advanced state representation for enabling reinforced agents to comprehend the current feature set better; and (2) resolving Q-value overestimation in reinforced agents for learning unbiased and effective policies. Finally, to make experiments more convincing than the preliminary work, we conclude by adding the outlier detection task with five datasets, evaluating various state representation approaches, and comparing different training strategies. Extensive experiments and case studies show that our work is more effective and superior.","2022-09-16","2022-11-04 15:59:06","2022-11-04 15:59:06","2022-11-04 15:59:06","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2209.08044 [cs]","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/HMZSHIH9/2022_Xia_Self-optimizing_feature_transformation.pdf; /Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/Y4X6MVDK/Xiao et al. - 2022 - Self-Optimizing Feature Transformation.pdf; /Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/X4DGH8PP/2209.html","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2209.08044","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, evaluation of knowledge graph completion (KGC) models often ignores the incompleteness -- facts in the test set are ranked against all unknown triplets which may contain a large number of missing facts not included in the KG yet. Treating all unknown triplets as false is called the closed-world assumption. This closed-world assumption might negatively affect the fairness and consistency of the evaluation metrics. In this paper, we study KGC evaluation under a more realistic setting, namely the open-world assumption, where unknown triplets are considered to include many missing facts not included in the training or test sets. For the currently most used metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and Hits@K, we point out that their behavior may be unexpected under the open-world assumption. Specifically, with not many missing facts, their numbers show a logarithmic trend with respect to the true strength of the model, and thus, the metric increase could be insignificant in terms of reflecting the true model improvement. Further, considering the variance, we show that the degradation in the reported numbers may result in incorrect comparisons between different models, where stronger models may have lower metric numbers. We validate the phenomenon both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we suggest possible causes and solutions for this problem.

With the proliferation of time series data, explainable forecasting remains a challenging task for business and operational decision making. Hybrid solutions are needed to bridge the gap between interpretable classical methods and scalable deep learning models. We view Prophet as a precursor to such a solution. However, Prophet lacks local context, which is essential for forecasting the near-term future and is challenging to extend due to its Stan backend. NeuralProphet is a hybrid forecasting framework based on PyTorch and trained with standard deep learning methods, making it easy for developers to extend the framework. Local context is introduced with auto-regression and covariate modules, which can be configured as classical linear regression or as Neural Networks. Otherwise, NeuralProphet retains the design philosophy of Prophet and provides the same basic model components. Our results demonstrate that NeuralProphet produces interpretable forecast components of equivalent or superior quality to Prophet on a set of generated time series. NeuralProphet outperforms Prophet on a diverse collection of real-world datasets.

All existing methods require clusters to be asymptotically independent. We prove under mild conditions that, in order for this requirement to hold for network-dependent data, it is necessary and sufficient that clusters have low conductance, the ratio of edge boundary size to volume. This yields a simple measure of cluster quality. We find in simulations that, when clusters have low conductance, cluster-robust methods better control size than HAC estimators. However, for important classes of networks lacking low-conductance clusters, the former can exhibit substantial size distortion. To assess the existence of low-conductance clusters and construct them, we draw on results in spectral graph theory that connect conductance to the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Based on these results, we propose to use the spectrum to determine the number of low-conductance clusters and spectral clustering to construct them.","2021","2022-11-08 14:14:35","2022-11-08 14:14:35","2022-11-08 14:14:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","Publisher: arXiv Version Number: 3","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/CJKUL66S/Leung - 2021 - Network Cluster-Robust Inference.pdf","","","Econometrics (econ.EM); FOS: Computer and information sciences; FOS: Economics and business; Methodology (stat.ME)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the graph is disconnected if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues equal to zero. Cheeger's inequality and its variants provide an approximate version of the latter fact; they state that a graph has a sparse cut if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues that are close to zero.                            It has been conjectured that an analogous characterization holds for higher multiplicities: There are               k               eigenvalues close to zero if and only if the vertex set can be partitioned into               k               subsets, each defining a sparse cut. We resolve this conjecture positively. Our result provides a theoretical justification for clustering algorithms that use the bottom               k               eigenvectors to embed the vertices into R                                k                              , and then apply geometric considerations to the embedding.                                         We also show that these techniques yield a nearly optimal quantitative connection between the expansion of sets of size ≈               n               /               k               and λ                                k                              , the               k               th smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian, where               n               is the number of vertices.

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together , our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.","","2022-11-09 12:28:10","2022-11-09 12:28:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Experimentation Keywords: Information networks, Feature learning, Node embed-dings, Graph representations; H28 [Database Manage-ment]: Database applications-Data mining; I26 [Artificial In-telligence]: Learning General Terms: Algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A popular approach to KB completion is to infer new relations by combinatory reasoning over the information found along other paths connecting a pair of entities. Given the enormous size of KBs and the exponential number of paths, previous path-based models have considered only the problem of predicting a missing relation given two entities or evaluating the truth of a proposed triple. Additionally, these methods have traditionally used random paths between fixed entity pairs or more recently learned to pick paths between them. We propose a new algorithm MINERVA, which addresses the much more difficult and practical task of answering questions where the relation is known, but only one entity. Since random walks are impractical in a setting with combinatorially many destinations from a start node, we present a neural reinforcement learning approach which learns how to navigate the graph conditioned on the input query to find predictive paths.

In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning framework to integrate induction of explainable rules from knowledge graph with construction of a rule-guided neural recommendation model. The framework encourages two modules to complement each other in generating effective and explainable recommendation: 1) inductive rules, mined from item-centric knowledge graphs, summarize common multi-hop relational patterns for inferring different item associations and provide human-readable explanation for model prediction; 2) recommendation module can be augmented by induced rules and thus have better generalization ability dealing with the cold-start issue. Extensive experiments1 show that our proposed method has achieved significant improvements in item recommendation over baselines on real-world datasets.

However, alongside this notable progress, they do not provide human-understandable insights on how a specific result was achieved. In contexts where the impact of AI on human life is relevant (e.g., recruitment tools, medical diagnoses, etc.), explainability is not only a desirable property, but it is -or, in some cases, it will be soon-a legal requirement. Most of the available approaches to implement eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focus on technical solutions usable only by experts able to manipulate the recursive mathematical functions in deep learning algorithms. A complementary approach is represented by symbolic AI, where symbols are elements of a lingua franca between humans and deep learning. In this context, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and their underlying semantic technologies are the modern implementation of symbolic AI&mdash;while being less flexible and robust to noise compared to deep learning models, KGs are natively developed to be explainable. In this paper, we review the main XAI approaches existing in the literature, underlying their strengths and limitations, and we propose neural-symbolic integration as a cornerstone to design an AI which is closer to non-insiders comprehension. Within such a general direction, we identify three specific challenges for future research&mdash;knowledge matching, cross-disciplinary explanations and interactive explanations.","2020","2022-11-09 12:28:10","2022-11-09 12:28:10","","","","2","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent approaches can broadly be classified into two categories: embedding-based approaches and path-based approaches. In contrast to embedding-based approaches, which operate in an uninterpretable latent semantic vector space of entities and relations, path-based approaches operate in the symbolic space, making the inference process explainable. However, traditionally, these approaches are studied with static snapshots of the knowledge graphs, severely restricting their applicability for dynamic knowledge graphs with newly emerging entities. To overcome this issue, we propose an inductive representation learning framework that is able to learn representations of previously unseen entities. Our method finds reasoning paths between source and target entities, thereby making the link prediction for unseen entities interpretable and providing support evidence for the inferred link.","2020","2022-11-09 12:28:10","2022-11-09 12:28:10","","","","","abs/2005.00637","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often explanations are given in form of model simplifications or visualizations. However, as shown in cognitive science as well as in early AI research, concept understanding can also be improved by the alignment of a given instance for a concept with a similar counterexample. Contrasting a given instance with a structurally similar example which does not belong to the concept highlights what characteristics are necessary for concept membership. Such near misses have been proposed by Winston (1970) as efficient guidance for learning in relational domains. We introduce an explanation generation algorithm for relational concepts learned with Inductive Logic Programming (GeNME). The algorithm identifies near miss examples from a given set of instances and ranks these examples by their degree of closeness to a specific positive instance. A modified rule which covers the near miss but not the original instance is given as an explanation. We illustrate GeNME with the well known family domain consisting of kinship relations, the visual relational Winston arches domain and a real-world domain dealing with file management. We also present a psychological experiment comparing human preferences of rule-based, example-based, and near miss explanations in the family and the arches domains.","","2022-11-09 12:28:10","2022-11-09 12:28:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, we propose the open link prediction task,i.e., predicting test facts by completing (``subject text'', ``relation text'', ?) questions. An evaluation in such a setup raises the question if a correct prediction is actually a new fact that was induced by reasoning over the open knowledge graph or if it can be trivially explained. For example, facts can appear in different paraphrased textual variants, which can lead to test leakage. To this end, we propose an evaluation protocol and a methodology for creating the open link prediction benchmark OlpBench. We performed experiments with a prototypical knowledge graph embedding model for openlink prediction. While the task is very challenging, our results suggests that it is possible to predict genuinely new facts, which can not be trivially explained.","2020-07","2022-11-09 12:28:11","2022-11-09 12:28:11","","2296-2308","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics","Online","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To mitigate this problem, we propose PairRE, a model with paired vectors for each relation representation. The paired vectors enable an adaptive adjust- ment of the margin in loss function to fit for complex relations. Besides, PairRE is capable of encoding three important relation patterns, symmetry/antisymmetry, inverse and composi- tion. Given simple constraints on relation rep- resentations, PairRE can encode subrelation further. Experiments on link prediction bench- marks demonstrate the proposed key capabili- ties of PairRE.

This creates the need to build a more complete knowledge graph for enhancing the practical utilization of KGs. Link prediction is a fundamental task in knowledge graph completion that utilizes existing relations to infer new relations so as to build a more complete knowledge graph. Numerous methods have been proposed to perform the link-prediction task based on various representation techniques. Among them, KG-embedding models have significantly advanced the state of the art in the past few years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on KG-embedding models for link prediction in knowledge graphs. We first provide a theoretical analysis and comparison of existing methods proposed to date for generating KG embedding. Then, we investigate several representative models that are classified into five categories. Finally, we conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets to report comprehensive findings and provide some new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing models.","2021","2022-11-09 12:28:11","2022-11-09 12:28:11","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present a new approach for knowledge graph embedding called RotatE, which is able to model and infer various relation patterns including: symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition. Specifically, the RotatE model defines each relation as a rotation from the source entity to the target entity in the complex vector space. In addition, we propose a novel self-adversarial negative sampling technique for efficiently and effectively training the RotatE model.

Link prediction can alleviate this by inferring a target entity, given a source entity and a query relation. Recent embedding-based approaches operate in an uninterpretable latent semantic vector space of entities and relations, while path-based approaches operate in the symbolic space, making the inference process explainable. However, these approaches typically consider static snapshots of the knowledge graphs, severely restricting their applicability for evolving knowledge graphs with newly emerging entities. To overcome this issue, we propose an inductive representation learning framework that is able to learn representations of previously unseen entities. Our method finds reasoning paths between source and target entities, thereby making the link prediction for unseen entities interpretable and providing support evidence for the inferred link.","2020","2022-11-09 12:28:11","2022-11-09 12:28:11","","39-55","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pan Jeff Z. and Tamma, Valentina and d'Amato Claudia and Janowicz Krzysztof and Fu Bo and Polleres Axel and Seneviratne Oshani and Kagal Lalana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The Semantic Web – ISWC 2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under this framework, we compare a variety of embedding models on the link prediction task. We show that a simple bilinear formulation achieves new state-of-the-art results for the task (achieving a top-10 accuracy of 73.2% vs. 54.7% by TransE on Freebase).

Most triples in these and other datasets in such studies belong to reverse and duplicate relations which exhibit high data redundancy due to semantic duplication, correlation or data incompleteness. This is a case of excessive data leakage---a model is trained using features that otherwise would not be available when the model needs to be applied for real prediction. There are also Cartesian product relations for which every triple formed by the Cartesian product of applicable subjects and objects is a true fact. Link prediction on the aforementioned relations is easy and can be achieved with even better accuracy using straightforward rules instead of sophisticated embedding models. A more fundamental defect of these models is that the link prediction scenario, given such data, is non-existent in the real-world. This paper is the first systematic study with the main objective of assessing the true effectiveness of embedding models when the unrealistic triples are removed. Our experiment results show these models are much less accurate than what we used to perceive. Their poor accuracy renders link prediction a task without truly effective automated solution.

Its exact maximization is NP-hard and prohibitively expensive for large graphs. Popular heuristics first perform a coarsening phase, where local search starting from singleton clusters is used to compute a preliminary clustering, and then optionally a refinement phase, where this clustering is improved by moving vertices between clusters. As a generalization, multilevel heuristics coarsen in several stages, and refine by moving entire clusters from each of these stages, not only individual vertices.             This article organizes existing and new single-level and multilevel heuristics into a coherent design space, and compares them experimentally with respect to their effectiveness (achieved modularity) and runtime. For coarsening by iterated cluster joining, it turns out that the most widely used criterion for joining clusters (modularity increase) is outperformed by other simple criteria, that a recent multistep algorithm [Schuetz and Caflisch 2008] is no improvement over simple single-step coarsening for these criteria, and that the recent multilevel coarsening by iterated vertex moving [Blondel et al. 2008] is somewhat faster but slightly less effective (with refinement). The new multilevel refinement is significantly more effective than the conventional single-level refinement or no refinement, in reasonable runtime.             A comparison with published benchmark results and algorithm implementations shows that multilevel local search heuristics, despite their relative simplicity, are competitive with the best algorithms in the literature.","2011-05","2022-11-12 07:25:31","2022-11-12 07:25:31","2022-11-12 07:25:31","","","","16","","ACM J.

However how good an algorithm is, in terms of accuracy and computing time, remains still open. Testing algorithms on real-world network has certain restrictions which made their insights potentially biased: the networks are usually small, and the underlying communities are not defined objectively. In this study, we employ the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark graph to test eight state-of-the-art algorithms. We quantify the accuracy using complementary measures and algorithms’ computing time. Based on simple network properties and the aforementioned results, we provide guidelines that help to choose the most adequate community detection algorithm for a given network. Moreover, these rules allow uncovering limitations in the use of specific algorithms given macroscopic network properties. Our contribution is threefold: firstly, we provide actual techniques to determine which is the most suited algorithm in most circumstances based on observable properties of the network under consideration. Secondly, we use the mixing parameter as an easily measurable indicator of finding the ranges of reliability of the different algorithms. Finally, we study the dependency with network size focusing on both the algorithm’s predicting power and the effective computing time.","2016-08-26","2022-11-13 15:27:33","2022-11-13 15:27:33","2022-11-13 15:27:33","30750","","1","6","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/q537342/Zotero/storage/ACHSBAX4/Yang et al. - 2016 - A Comparative Analysis of Community Detection Algo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PAGA maps provide interpretable discrete and continuous latent coordinates for both disconnected and continuous structure in data, preserve the global topology of data, allow analyzing data at different resolutions and result in much higher computational efficiency of the typical exploratory data analysis workflow — one million cells take on the order of a minute, a speedup of 130 times compared to UMAP.

To date, the most effective methods are based on embedding models, representing entities and relationships as a multi-dimensional vectors in a vector space. Explaining the results of this task means finding a meaningful reason for which entities are predicted as linked. This work presents a structural and semantically enriched approach for generating explanations for link predictions, by exploring the data available in the knowledge graph. The solution searches for paths and examples of similar situations that justify the prediction carried out using numerical approaches. Specifically, CrossE is adopted as the underlying embedding model to compute predictions. Then explanations are searched exploiting ad hoc semantic similarity measures. The proposed solution has been experimentally evaluated, showing that the new approach is able to provide meaningful explanations compared to the considered baseline.","2022","2022-11-17 10:55:08","2022-11-17 10:55:08","","170-177","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","embedding models; explanation; Knowledge Graphs; link prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To solve these problems, in this paper we propose a generation-then-evaluation rule mining approach guided by reinforcement learning. Specifically, a two-phased framework is designed. The first phase aims to train a reinforcement learning agent for rule generation from KGs, and the second is to utilize the value function of the agent to guide the step-by-step rule generation.

In particular, it is unclear what it means to be interpretable and how to select, evaluate, or even discuss methods for producing interpretations of machine-learning models. We aim to clarify these concerns by defining interpretable machine learning and constructing a unifying framework for existing methods which highlights the underappreciated role played by human audiences. Within this framework, methods are organized into 2 classes: model based and post hoc. To provide guidance in selecting and evaluating interpretation methods, we introduce 3 desiderata: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy. Using our framework, we review existing work, grounded in real-world studies which exemplify our desiderata, and suggest directions for future work. , Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.","2019","2022-11-17 10:55:08","2022-11-17 10:55:08","","22071-22080","","44","116","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We summarise methods for the creation, enrichment, quality assessment, refinement, and publication of knowledge graphs. We provide an overview of prominent open knowledge graphs and enterprise knowledge graphs, their applications, and how they use the aforementioned techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions for knowledge graphs.","2022","2022-11-17 10:55:08","2022-11-17 10:55:08","","1-37","","4","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Databases; Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing.

Our framework---which we term ""Graph Network-based Simulators"" (GNS)---represents the state of a physical system with particles, expressed as nodes in a graph, and computes dynamics via learned message-passing. Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework advances the state-of-the-art in learned physical simulation, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.","2020","2022-11-17 10:55:09","2022-11-17 10:55:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Physics - Computational Physics; Statistics - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This however comes at the cost of dubious trustworthiness and significant risk of exposure to 'fake news', intentionally written to mislead the readers. Automatically detecting fake news poses challenges that defy existing content-based analysis approaches. One of the main reasons is that often the interpretation of the news requires the knowledge of political or social context or 'common sense', which current NLP algorithms are still missing. Recent studies have shown that fake and real news spread differently on social media, forming propagation patterns that could be harnessed for the automatic fake news detection. Propagation-based approaches have multiple advantages compared to their content-based counterparts, among which is language independence and better resilience to adversarial attacks. In this paper we show a novel automatic fake news detection model based on geometric deep learning. The underlying core algorithms are a generalization of classical CNNs to graphs, allowing the fusion of heterogeneous data such as content, user profile and activity, social graph, and news propagation. Our model was trained and tested on news stories, verified by professional fact-checking organizations, that were spread on Twitter. Our experiments indicate that social network structure and propagation are important features allowing highly accurate (92.7% ROC AUC) fake news detection. Second, we observe that fake news can be reliably detected at an early stage, after just a few hours of propagation. Third, we test the aging of our model on training and testing data separated in time. Our results point to the promise of propagation-based approaches for fake news detection as an alternative or complementary strategy to content-based approaches.","2019","2022-11-17 10:55:09","2022-11-17 10:55:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Social and Information Networks; Statistics - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of knowledge graph covering overall research topics about 1) knowledge graph representation learning, 2) knowledge acquisition and completion, 3) temporal knowledge graph, and 4) knowledge-aware applications, and summarize recent breakthroughs and perspective directions to facilitate future research. We propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these topics. Knowledge graph embedding is organized from four aspects of representation space, scoring function, encoding models, and auxiliary information. For knowledge acquisition, especially knowledge graph completion, embedding methods, path inference, and logical rule reasoning, are reviewed. We further explore several emerging topics, including meta relational learning, commonsense reasoning, and temporal knowledge graphs. To facilitate future research on knowledge graphs, we also provide a curated collection of datasets and open-source libraries on different tasks. In the end, we have a thorough outlook on several promising research directions.","2022","2022-11-17 10:55:09","2022-11-17 10:55:09","","494-514","","2","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together , our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.","","2022-11-17 10:55:10","2022-11-17 10:55:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Experimentation Keywords: Information networks, Feature learning, Node embed-dings, Graph representations; H28 [Database Manage-ment]: Database applications-Data mining; I26 [Artificial In-telligence]: Learning General Terms: Algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GCN-based KGC models first use GCNs to generate expressive entity representations and then use knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models to capture the interactions among entities and relations. However, many GCN-based KGC models fail to outperform state-of-the-art KGE models though introducing additional computational complexity. This phenomenon motivates us to explore the real effect of GCNs in KGC. Therefore, in this paper, we build upon representative GCN-based KGC models and introduce variants to find which factor of GCNs is critical in KGC. Surprisingly, we observe from experiments that the graph structure modeling in GCNs does not have a significant impact on the performance of KGC models, which is in contrast to the common belief. Instead, the transformations for entity representations are responsible for the performance improvements. Based on the observation, we propose a simple yet effective framework named LTE-KGE, which equips existing KGE models with linearly transformed entity embeddings. Experiments demonstrate that LTE-KGE models lead to similar performance improvements with GCN-based KGC methods, while being more computationally efficient. These results suggest that existing GCNs are unnecessary for KGC, and novel GCN-based KGC models should count on more ablation studies to validate their effectiveness.

A popular approach to KB completion is to infer new relations by combinatory reasoning over the information found along other paths connecting a pair of entities. Given the enormous size of KBs and the exponential number of paths, previous path-based models have considered only the problem of predicting a missing relation given two entities or evaluating the truth of a proposed triple. Additionally, these methods have traditionally used random paths between fixed entity pairs or more recently learned to pick paths between them. We propose a new algorithm MINERVA, which addresses the much more difficult and practical task of answering questions where the relation is known, but only one entity. Since random walks are impractical in a setting with combinatorially many destinations from a start node, we present a neural reinforcement learning approach which learns how to navigate the graph conditioned on the input query to find predictive paths. Empirically, this approach obtains state-of-the-art results on several datasets, significantly outperforming prior methods.","2017","2022-11-17 10:55:10","2022-11-17 10:55:10","","","","","abs/1711.05851","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning framework to integrate induction of explainable rules from knowledge graph with construction of a rule-guided neural recommendation model. The framework encourages two modules to complement each other in generating effective and explainable recommendation: 1) inductive rules, mined from item-centric knowledge graphs, summarize common multi-hop relational patterns for inferring different item associations and provide human-readable explanation for model prediction; 2) recommendation module can be augmented by induced rules and thus have better generalization ability dealing with the cold-start issue.

In contexts where the impact of AI on human life is relevant (e.g., recruitment tools, medical diagnoses, etc.), explainability is not only a desirable property, but it is -or, in some cases, it will be soon-a legal requirement. Most of the available approaches to implement eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focus on technical solutions usable only by experts able to manipulate the recursive mathematical functions in deep learning algorithms. A complementary approach is represented by symbolic AI, where symbols are elements of a lingua franca between humans and deep learning. In this context, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and their underlying semantic technologies are the modern implementation of symbolic AI&mdash;while being less flexible and robust to noise compared to deep learning models, KGs are natively developed to be explainable.

Recently, KGs are popularly used as the auxiliary information to enable more accurate, explainable, and diverse user preference recommendations. Specifically, existing KG-based recommendation methods target modeling high-order relations/dependencies from long connectivity user-item interactions hidden in KG. However, most of them ignore the cold-start problems (i.e., user cold-start and item cold-start) of recommendation analytics, which restricts their performance in scenarios when involving new users or new items. Inspired by the success of meta-learning on scarce training samples, we propose a novel meta-learning based framework called MetaKG, which encompasses a collaborative-aware meta learner and a knowledge-aware meta learner, to capture meta users' preference and entities' knowledge for cold-start recommendations. The collaborative-aware meta learner aims to locally aggregate user preferences for each user preference learning task. In contrast, the knowledge-aware meta learner is to globally generalize knowledge representation across different user preference learning tasks. Guided by two meta learners, MetaKG can effectively capture the high-order collaborative relations and semantic representations, which could be easily adapted to cold-start scenarios. Besides, we devise a novel adaptive task scheduler which can adaptively select the informative tasks for meta learning in order to prevent the model from being corrupted by noisy tasks. Extensive experiments on various cold-start scenarios using three real data sets demonstrate that our presented MetaKG outperforms all the existing state-of-the-art competitors in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.","2022-02","2022-11-17 10:55:10","2022-11-17 10:55:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent approaches can broadly be classified into two categories: embedding-based approaches and path-based approaches. In contrast to embedding-based approaches, which operate in an uninterpretable latent semantic vector space of entities and relations, path-based approaches operate in the symbolic space, making the inference process explainable. However, traditionally, these approaches are studied with static snapshots of the knowledge graphs, severely restricting their applicability for dynamic knowledge graphs with newly emerging entities. To overcome this issue, we propose an inductive representation learning framework that is able to learn representations of previously unseen entities.

As of late, explainable AI has become a very active ﬁeld of research by addressing the limitations of the latest machine learning solutions that often provide highly accurate, but hardly scrutable and interpretable decisions. An increasing interest has also been shown in the integration of Knowledge Representation techniques in Machine Learning applications, mostly motivated by the complementary strengths and weaknesses that could lead to a new generation of hybrid intelligent systems. Following this idea, we hypothesise that knowledge graphs, which naturally provide domain background knowledge in a machine-readable format, could be integrated in Explainable Machine Learning approaches to help them provide more meaningful, insightful and trustworthy explanations. Using a systematic literature review methodology we designed an analytical framework to explore the current landscape of Explainable Machine Learning. We focus particularly on the integration with structured knowledge at large scale, and use our framework to analyse a variety of Machine Learning domains, identifying the main characteristics of such knowledge-based, explainable systems from different perspectives. We then summarise the strengths of such hybrid systems, such as improved understandability, reactivity, and accuracy, as well as their limitations, e.g. in handling noise or extracting knowledge eﬃciently. We conclude by discussing a list of open challenges left for future research.","2022","2022-11-17 10:55:10","2022-11-17 10:55:10","","103627-103627","","","302","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Knowledge_graphs; Neuro-symbolic integration; Subsymbolic AI; Symbolic AI; XAI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often explanations are given in form of model simplifications or visualizations. However, as shown in cognitive science as well as in early AI research, concept understanding can also be improved by the alignment of a given instance for a concept with a similar counterexample. Contrasting a given instance with a structurally similar example which does not belong to the concept highlights what characteristics are necessary for concept membership. Such near misses have been proposed by Winston (1970) as efficient guidance for learning in relational domains. We introduce an explanation generation algorithm for relational concepts learned with Inductive Logic Programming (GeNME). The algorithm identifies near miss examples from a given set of instances and ranks these examples by their degree of closeness to a specific positive instance. A modified rule which covers the near miss but not the original instance is given as an explanation. We illustrate GeNME with the well known family domain consisting of kinship relations, the visual relational Winston arches domain and a real-world domain dealing with file management. We also present a psychological experiment comparing human preferences of rule-based, example-based, and near miss explanations in the family and the arches domains.","","2022-11-17 10:55:10","2022-11-17 10:55:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our recent survey, we devised and applied data quality criteria to the above-mentioned knowledge graphs. Furthermore, we proposed a framework for finding the most suitable knowledge graph for a given setting.

As GNNs tightly entangle the input graph into the neural network structure, common explainable AI approaches are not applicable. To a large extent, GNNs have remained black-boxes for the user so far. In this paper, we show that GNNs can in fact be naturally explained using higher-order expansions, i.e. by identifying groups of edges that jointly contribute to the prediction. Practically, we find that such explanations can be extracted using a nested attribution scheme, where existing techniques such as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) can be applied at each step. The output is a collection of walks into the input graph that are relevant for the prediction. Our novel explanation method, which we denote by GNN-LRP, is applicable to a broad range of graph neural networks and lets us extract practically relevant insights on sentiment analysis of text data, structure-property relationships in quantum chemistry, and image classification.","2020-06","2022-11-17 10:55:11","2022-11-17 10:55:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, a promising approach to this problem has been to embed KG entities as well as the query into a vector space such that entities that answer the query are embedded close to the query. However, prior work models queries as single points in the vector space, which is problematic because a complex query represents a potentially large set of its answer entities, but it is unclear how such a set can be represented as a single point. Furthermore, prior work can only handle queries that use conjunctions ($\wedge$) and existential quantifiers ($\exists$). Handling queries with logical disjunctions ($\vee$) remains an open problem. Here we propose query2box, an embedding-based framework for reasoning over arbitrary queries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, and $\exists$ operators in massive and incomplete KGs. Our main insight is that queries can be embedded as boxes (i.e., hyper-rectangles), where a set of points inside the box corresponds to a set of answer entities of the query. We show that conjunctions can be naturally represented as intersections of boxes and also prove a negative result that handling disjunctions would require embedding with dimension proportional to the number of KG entities. However, we show that by transforming queries into a Disjunctive Normal Form, query2box is capable of handling arbitrary logical queries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\exists$ in a scalable manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of query2box on three large KGs and show that query2box achieves up to 25% relative improvement over the state of the art.","2020-02","2022-11-17 10:55:11","2022-11-17 10:55:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to infer new facts directly from the open knowledge graph without any canonicalization or any supervision from curated knowledge. For this purpose, we propose the open link prediction task,i.e., predicting test facts by completing (``subject text'', ``relation text'', ?) questions. An evaluation in such a setup raises the question if a correct prediction is actually a new fact that was induced by reasoning over the open knowledge graph or if it can be trivially explained. For example, facts can appear in different paraphrased textual variants, which can lead to test leakage. To this end, we propose an evaluation protocol and a methodology for creating the open link prediction benchmark OlpBench. We performed experiments with a prototypical knowledge graph embedding model for openlink prediction. While the task is very challenging, our results suggests that it is possible to predict genuinely new facts, which can not be trivially explained.","2020-07","2022-11-17 10:55:11","2022-11-17 10:55:11","","2296-2308","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics","Online","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the success of Wikidata, Google decided in 2014 to offer the content of Freebase to the Wikidata community. In this paper, we report on the ongoing transfer efforts and data mapping challenges, and provide an analysis of the effort so far. We describe the Primary Sources Tool, which aims to facilitate this and future data migrations. Throughout the migration, we have gained deep insights into both Wikidata and Freebase, and share and discuss detailed statistics on both knowledge bases.","2016","2022-11-17 10:55:11","2022-11-17 10:55:11","","1419-1428","","","","","","","","","","","International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee","Republic and Canton of Geneva, CHE","","","","","","","","","","","","crowdsourcing systems; freebase; semantic web; wikidata","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the existing methods fail to solve these two problems at the same time, which leads to unsatisfactory results. To mitigate this problem, we propose PairRE, a model with paired vectors for each relation representation. The paired vectors enable an adaptive adjust- ment of the margin in loss function to fit for complex relations. Besides, PairRE is capable of encoding three important relation patterns, symmetry/antisymmetry, inverse and composi- tion. Given simple constraints on relation rep- resentations, PairRE can encode subrelation further. Experiments on link prediction bench- marks demonstrate the proposed key capabili- ties of PairRE. Moreover, We set a new state- of-the-art on two knowledge graph datasets of the challenging Open Graph Benchmark.","2020","2022-11-17 10:55:11","2022-11-17 10:55:11","","","","","abs/2011.03798","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This creates the need to build a more complete knowledge graph for enhancing the practical utilization of KGs. Link prediction is a fundamental task in knowledge graph completion that utilizes existing relations to infer new relations so as to build a more complete knowledge graph. Numerous methods have been proposed to perform the link-prediction task based on various representation techniques. Among them, KG-embedding models have significantly advanced the state of the art in the past few years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on KG-embedding models for link prediction in knowledge graphs. We first provide a theoretical analysis and comparison of existing methods proposed to date for generating KG embedding. Then, we investigate several representative models that are classified into five categories. Finally, we conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets to report comprehensive findings and provide some new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing models.","2021","2022-11-17 10:55:11","2022-11-17 10:55:11","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The success of such a task heavily relies on the ability of modeling and inferring the patterns of (or between) the relations. In this paper, we present a new approach for knowledge graph embedding called RotatE, which is able to model and infer various relation patterns including: symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition. Specifically, the RotatE model defines each relation as a rotation from the source entity to the target entity in the complex vector space. In addition, we propose a novel self-adversarial negative sampling technique for efficiently and effectively training the RotatE model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that the proposed RotatE model is not only scalable, but also able to infer and model various relation patterns and significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction.","2019","2022-11-17 10:55:11","2022-11-17 10:55:11","","","","","abs/1902.10197","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, increasing efforts are put into exploring semi- and fully inductive scenarios, enabling inference over unseen and emerging entities. Still, all these approaches only consider triple-based \glspl{kg}, whereas their richer counterparts, hyper-relational KGs (e.g., Wikidata), have not yet been properly studied. In this work, we classify different inductive settings and study the benefits of employing hyper-relational KGs on a wide range of semi- and fully inductive link prediction tasks powered by recent advancements in graph neural networks.

Link prediction can alleviate this by inferring a target entity, given a source entity and a query relation. Recent embedding-based approaches operate in an uninterpretable latent semantic vector space of entities and relations, while path-based approaches operate in the symbolic space, making the inference process explainable. However, these approaches typically consider static snapshots of the knowledge graphs, severely restricting their applicability for evolving knowledge graphs with newly emerging entities. To overcome this issue, we propose an inductive representation learning framework that is able to learn representations of previously unseen entities. Our method finds reasoning paths between source and target entities, thereby making the link prediction for unseen entities interpretable and providing support evidence for the inferred link.","2020","2022-11-17 10:55:11","2022-11-17 10:55:11","","39-55","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pan Jeff Z. and Tamma, Valentina and d'Amato Claudia and Janowicz Krzysztof and Fu Bo and Polleres Axel and Seneviratne Oshani and Kagal Lalana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The Semantic Web – ISWC 2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
